# 🎯 API Quiz Game - ApexPlanet Internship (Task 3)

This is my **Task 3 project** for the ApexPlanet Internship.  
The objective was to **fetch real-time data from an API using JavaScript** and build a **responsive, interactive quiz application**.

## 🌟 Features
- 🎨 Beautiful gradient background (`linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`).
- 💡 **Dynamic quiz questions** generated in real-time from [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/).  
   🔄 Each quiz session generates **new random questions** – no two games are the same!
- 📚 **Category & Difficulty selection** before starting the quiz.
- 🏆 **Score tracking** displayed in real-time.
- ⏳ **Progress bar** to track quiz completion.
- 🎇 **Particle effects** when answering correctly.
- 📱 Fully **responsive layout**.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Select your **preferred category and difficulty**.  
2. The app fetches **5 fresh multiple-choice questions** generated from the Trivia API.  
3. Answer the questions – your **score updates live**.  
4. Correct answers trigger **particle animations** 🎇.  
5. At the end, the quiz displays your final score.
